# Devoid
I do not know what kind of game I want to make. However, it will be pretty simple.
I want to emulate a old school top down 2D game. A Link to the Past is the old school game I think of.
I really do not play much video games anymore. But I thought I would be fun to create a 
another 2D by using a framework like MonoGame. I do not want to use SDL2 anymore since
it is way too bare bones for my liking and I am not a fan of using C/C++.

## Setup
1. [Install Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
2. Install Monogame extension for Visual Studio 2022 \
	1. Go to "Extensions -> Manage Extensions" -> Search "monogame"

## Run the game
The command to run the program without Visual Studio. This is mean't for running on Linux.
```
dotnet run --project Devoid
```
